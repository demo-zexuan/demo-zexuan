### Hi there 👋

I'm studying for the Postgraduate Entrance Examination now.

I have 3 years work experience in back-end development, mainly using Java and Python.

—— Q: Why am I trying to get a master's degree?

—— A: I'm tired of being a common programmer. I have worked for years without getting a promotion or higher salary, so I
chose another way to improve myself.
